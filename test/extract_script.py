"""Print the shell body of one step of action.yml (the auth step by default).

Usage: extract_script.py [action.yml] [step-id]

The tests execute this body directly instead of going through `uses: ./` so
that its log output and the files it writes can be asserted on. Extracting
it from action.yml keeps action.yml the single source of truth — a copy of
the script in the test tree would drift.
